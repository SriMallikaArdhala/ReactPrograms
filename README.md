This repository contains React applications built during my course curriculum, showcasing components, state, hooks, and routing. Each program (e.g., myapp) is in its own folder with a package.json. To run: clone the repo, navigate to a program folder (e.g., cd myapp), run npm install, then npm start to launch at http://localhost:3000. Ensure Node.js (14.x+) and npm are installed.
