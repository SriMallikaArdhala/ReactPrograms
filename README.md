**How to Run the React Applications**
Follow these steps to run any React application in this repository, using myapp as an example:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/SriMallikaArdhala/react-programs.git
Replace SriMallikaArdhala/react-programs with your repository’s URL.
Navigate to the Project Folder:
cd react-programs/myapp
Replace myapp with the folder name of the program you want to run (e.g., todo-app).
Install Dependencies:
npm install
This installs all required packages listed in the project’s package.json.
Start the Development Server:
npm start
This launches the React application in development mode. The app will open automatically in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. If it doesn’t, navigate to that URL manually.
Interact with the Application:
Explore the app’s features in the browser.
To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

**For example, in myapp:**
The app likely includes a main App.js component rendering a simple UI.
State changes (e.g., button clicks, form inputs) are managed with useState.
The UI is styled with CSS in src/App.css or similar.

**Troubleshooting**
Port Conflict: If localhost:3000 is in use, React will suggest another port (e.g., 3001). Accept or free the port by closing other applications.
Dependency Errors: If npm install fails, delete node_modules and package-lock.json in the project folder, then rerun npm install.
Node Version: Use Node.js 14.x or higher. Switch versions with nvm (Node Version Manager) if needed.
Browser Issues: Clear the browser cache or try a different browser if the app doesn’t load.
Missing Libraries: If a program requires specific dependencies (e.g., react-router-dom), they are installed via npm install.

**Additional Notes**:
All programs were created using create-react-app or a similar setup, ensuring a standard structure.
The myapp folder is a primary example tested with npm start. Other programs follow the same run process.
